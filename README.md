# Title: Employee Tracker

## Description: 
App uses node.js inquirer and mysql to create a database for employees. Used these technologies to be able to write frombackend creating an informative database for companies to use. I faced the challenges of getting different files to work with eachother and properly integrate this was by far the hardest assignment yet, it is coming together and making more sense but I wanted to give up multiple times thinking I wasn't capable of doing it took a break then found the solution in a couple hours when my mind was refreshed. I could implement in the future getting rid of the IDs incase they didn't know the specific ID but knew the title. However you can check for the ID's easily to still make an efficient database.

## How to install and run:
Install node js run npm i for the required dependencies in the terminal on the file directory, also have mysql installed.

## How to use:
Once installed the required dependencies login to mysql then from the run the node index.js to start the prompts and create your database from user input.
